This is an implementation of Krall et.al 2019 for seawater only.
Note that equation 11 is used and necessary coefficents are found in the paper supplement.

Important note: This parameterisation was developed in the Heidelberg wind wave
tank. It is not always clear which processes are being accurately simulated in
wind/wave tanks. For this reason it should not be assumed that results from 
tank experiments are completely representative of the open ocean. If users wish 
to use this parameterisation they should be aware of its potential limitations 
when applied in the open ocean.
